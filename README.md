Welcome to Soiree! 
By Gabriel Inniss & Clifford Etienne

*Please Note that this is a fork of the original Soiree, with the frontend remade in React.js*

Our app, Soirée, is made for those who want to be the life of the party! This app allows users to not only host parties, but see if there are any parties that they'd like to go to. On Soirée, users can make posts detailing the party(ies) that they'd like to host, with a location and picture of said venue. Other users can choose to either RSVP or not to that party for any reason.  

Database Tables: 
- Users 
- Parties
- RSVPs
